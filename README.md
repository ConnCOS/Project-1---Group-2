# Colorado Bike Data
## Scope:

The scope of the project involved using data from bicycle and pedestrian counts in 20 counties across Colorado from 2009 to 2015. Python, Jupyter Notebook, and GitHub were utilized for data analysis. The primary objectives were to determine bicycle path and crossing usage rates in the state and analyze peak months and days of the week for bicycle traffic. Additionally, the team sought to overlay bicycle shop locations to identify correlations between retail locations and traffic counts, as well as opportunities for new retail locations. Some limitations were faced due to non-uniform data availability and limited initial data from certain counties. The analysis focused on county-level data rather than city-level data due to the data's availability.

## Questioning the data: Steps to evaluating data:
1. Decompose the ask
2. Identify data sources â€“ state of Colorado
3. Define strategy and metrics
4. Build a data retrieval plan
5. Retrieve the data
6. Assemble and clean the data
7. Analyze for trends
8. Acknowledge limitations
10. Make the call



## Questions to seek from the data:

**The questions addressed by Group 2 during the analysis included:**

1. Which counties in Colorado have the highest bicycle traffic based on total bicycle and bicycle/pedestrian counts?
2. What are the most popular months for biking statewide?
3. Which days of the week are most popular for biking statewide?
4. Is there a variation in ridership popularity between highly populated areas like Denver County and smaller tourist counties like Garfield County, as well as midsize counties?
5. Within each county, which trails are the most popular?

## Conclusions:

The conclusions drawn from the analysis are as follows:

1. The data provided by the state was free, relatively clean, and easy to work with but was limited to only about one-third of the counties in Colorado.

2. When comparing ridership data at the county level, differences in daily ridership were observed, particularly in midsize metro areas.

3. The data allowed for examination of ridership based on location.

4. The analysis would have been more nuanced if other data, such as income levels or altitude, were incorporated.

5. El Paso County, the second-most populous county in the state, showed peak ridership on Thursdays and other weekdays, with the lowest ridership on weekends. Comparing income levels, El Paso County had higher income than Denver but lower than Garfield County in 2014.

6. In Garfield County, Sunday remained the most popular day for biking, while the second-most popular day shifted from Saturday to Tuesday.

7. The database also enabled comparisons of trails and paths within each county, revealing higher ridership in affluent areas in Denver County.
